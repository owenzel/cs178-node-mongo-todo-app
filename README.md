This is a short-assignment for the Harvard CS 178: Engineering Usable Interactive Systems class. I followed a To-Do App [tutorial](https://medium.com/@diogo.fg.pinheiro/simple-to-do-list-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-chapter-1-c645c7a27583) for Node & MongoDB.

Follow the linked tutorial to create a MongoDB cluster a .env file with the appropriate `DB_CONNECT` variable. Then, you can run the web app via `npm start` and view it on http://localhost:3000/.
